Towards IoT Convergence

Bryan Che - Senior Director Cloud Product Strategy at Red Hat

Three trends shaping IoT.
1. Consumerization of IT (Information Technology)
2. Digitization of OT (Operational Technology)
3. IoT convergence
Consumerization of IT.
Mobility tools.
63% increased worker productivity.
50% increased customer satisfaction.
Delivery pipeline, monthly, not ~2 years.
Red Hat Mobile Application "Platform".
Digitizing healthcare, mobile assets.
Huge transformation.
Regulated industry, HIPAA.
Digitization of OT.
Railroad industry, 99.999% reliability SLA.
Positive train control.
Mandated by 2015, but will take until 2020.
Must think about speed of deployment.
Connectivity and management of solar in every house.
Will compress lifecycles, years to weeks.
Raspberry Pi is more powerful than cloud server of few years ago.
This will accelerate.
Architectures will converge: Data Center, Gateways, Devices.
Linux containers provide consistent building blocks.
Secure at the core.
Isolation of hosts.
Are sources trusted?
What's inside containers?
Trust is temporal.
Need holistic view of convergence.
Need orchestration tools.
