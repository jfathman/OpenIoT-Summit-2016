MQTT - IoT Messaging Protocol

Francisco Quintero, Lead Software/Embedded Firmware Engineer at Verizon Telematics

99% of devices are still unconnected.
Distributed network.
Run on batteries or limited power.
Unreliable networks.
No need to write app messaging protocol from scratch on top of TCP/IP.
MQTT handles roaming in/out of coverage.
MQTT broker mosquitto is well supported.
MQTT is lightweight pub/sub.
Invented in 1999 by Andy Stanford-Clark (IBM) to send sensor data
from oil pipelines through satellite link.
Reliable bi-directional messaging.
High volume data, low bandwidth networks.
Small code footprint.
Runs on top of TCP/IP.
Client and broker need TCP/IP stack.
Event oriented, push, avoids polling.
Recovery, store and forward, pub-sub.
Runs on STM32F4 MCU, very small.
Broker decides which subscribers to notify.
'topic' string is like a Redis channel.
Topic is a hierarchical structured string.
MQTT in C = 30KB, Java = 100KB.
Client libs C/C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, etc.
Broker is a receiver for messages.
Handles authentication, authorization.
Scalable, easy to integrate in backend systems.
Connection initiated by client.
ClientID unique ID per broker.
Username/password in plain text, user must encrypt.
CleanSession = false flag, persistence / storage.
Publish, subscribe, and unsubscribe.
Payload, binary form, up to 260 MB.
KeepAlive.
Notify other clients if client disconnects ungracefully.
Wireless reality, get ungraceful disconnects 80% of the time.
Topics case sensitive, UTF-8, supports wildcards + and #.
QoS levels:
 0 - at most once, no acks, not stored
 1 - at least once, could be more than once
 2 - exactly once, highest QoS, but slowest
QoS is set by client.
May be downgraded by broker.
Session identified by ClientID.
Message order is preserved, queued.
Retained messages.
Client takeover, client reconnects based on same ClientID,
will close prior connection.
MQTT requires 5 times less bytes than HTTP.
Reliable delivery.
MQTT used in POS, telematics, many more.
Facebook uses MQTT for Messenger protocol.
Amazon uses MQTT for AWS IoT.
Amazon AWS IoT: HTTP, MQTT, WebSockets.
Eclipse Paho project, C/C++ MQTT libs.
