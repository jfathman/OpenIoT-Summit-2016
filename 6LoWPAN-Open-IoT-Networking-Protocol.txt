6LoWPAN - An Open IoT Networking Protocol

Stefan Schmidt, Senior Software Engineer at Samsung

6LoWPAN, IPv6 over Low power WPAN (wireless personal area network).
Open, specified by IETF.
Designed and developed in public.
IPv6 often used with CoAP, MQTT, etc.
Motivation, battery powered sensors.
WiFi access points, gateways.
Home use, industrial use, IEEE 802.15.4.
Motivation, 6LoWPAN.
IPv6, less than full TCP/IP stack.
Sensors only transfer a little data.
Motivation, Linux-wpan.
802.15.4 subsystem in Linux kernel.
Integrate 802.15.4 chips in Linux devices.
Movement towards IP.
IoT modeled on success of the Internet.
But TCP/IP is not one size fits all.
Dev boards: Ci40, Artik 5/10, RPi with openlabs shield.
Products using 802.15.4: Google Nest thermostat, Google OnHub router.
802.15.4 often mixed up with ZigBee, which above L2 is proprietary.
No ZigBee support for Linux kernel, non-GPL.
IEEE 802.15.4 / LoWPAN.
Specifies physical / MAC layer.
Simple addressing, no routing.
Star and peer-to-peer topologies.
Good for battery powered devices.
Mesh needs extra layers.
6LoWPAN.
Auto-configuration, neighbor discovery.
Header and payload compression.
Becomes part of network layer (IP layers).
IPv6 max packet size 1280 bytes, but 802.15.4 has 127 byte MTU.
Need fragmentation scheme.
Avoid large packet sizes.
Header size problem.
33 bytes payload out of 127 byte MTU, bad ratio.
People not happy with IPv6 over LoWPAN.
So header compression.
Headers: 6LoWPAN 9 bytes, IPv6 40 bytes.
6LoWPAN compression.
IPHC, EAP, NHC (not HC1, HC2, deprecated).
NHC, RFC 6282, global, multicast.
Draft specs to compress TCP/IP.
Use with UDP is best.
Reduce 48 byte IPv6 + UDP headers to 6 bytes out of 127 byte frame (MTU).
Generic header compression, RFC 7400.
Dictionary static on every node.
Stateless address autoconfiguration.
FE80::/64 prefix.
RFC 6775 neighbor discovery for 6LoWPAN.
Bluetooth LE relationship.
IETF spec IPv6 over BTLE, RFC 7668.
Compression.
Linux kernel shares wpan and Bluetooth subsystems.
NFC, DECT, PLC (powerline), 6loBAC, RS-485.
Linux-wpan status report.
802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN in Linux kernel.

Architecture:
       http ssh
       udp  tcp
         IPv6
  lowpan0 | lowpan1
       6LoWPAN         <-- handles fragmentation reassembly
    wpan0 | wpan1

Chips: at86rf2xx, mrf24j40, cc2520, atusb, adf7242.
Connection --
Linux to Linux devices.
Linux to Contiki devices.
Linux to RIOT devices.
Future work.
Beacon and MAC command frame support.
Scan for available PANs.
Short address handling.
Improve existing drivers.
Support new hardware.
Neighbor discovery optimization, RFC 6775 6LoWPAN.
Interoperability.
Linux-wpan.
Basic tests with Contiki.
RIOT OS developers test against Linux-wpan.
Formal plugtest.
Misc.
RFC 6550 routing protocol for low power and lossy network.
Google Thread network protocol uses many parts of 6LoWPAN.
Potential for cooperation.
Thread spec might be available to public later.
