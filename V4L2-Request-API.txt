V4L2 on Steroids: The Request API

Laurent Pinchart, Owner at Ideas on Board

Key concepts, userspace /dev/video*, format, crop, compose, scale.
Set controls, 175 controls.
Allocate DMA buffer, queue of buffers.
Start video stream.
Queue/dequeue event notifications.
Stop video stream.
Device modes, YUV, MPEG.
Bridge driver, /dev/video*.
Decoder driver, /dev/v4l-subdev*.
Media controller, separate API.
Model the video device.
Pipeline, any output connects to any input.
Problems:
How to synchronize controls to buffers.
Want userspace to apply many parameters to single frame.
Start/stop video stream to change parameters.
Leads to start/stop for every frame.
The Request API:
Group all parameters into a 'Request'.
QBUF, CMD_REQ(QUEUE)
CMD_REQ(BEGIN), CMD_REQ(ALLOC)
Implementation:
ALLOC REQ
QUEUE REQ
DELETE REQ
Control framework.
Next:
Pass metadata from device for every frame captured.
Kernel pass to user space.

Don't want two implementations in kernel.
So transition to new implementation.
Multiple rounds of patches.
