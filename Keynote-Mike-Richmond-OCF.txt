Keynote

Ensuring IoT Devices and Solutions Work Seamlessly Together

Mike Richmond - Executive Director OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation)
Greg Burns - Chief IoT Software Technologist at Intel

Conference industrial complex.
Many IoT conferences are about business model for firms, not attendees.
But Embedded Linux Conference is about actual attendees, developers.
OCF sponsors IoTivity, an open source framework for device connectivity.
There are a bunch of groups all trying to solve interoperability.
Groups produce specs, then need open source implementation.
Why are there geo-specific groups, redundant?
Need open source and standards.
This is starting again with IoT, web is a good model of what works.
IoT will not be built by embedded developers.
9M mobile developers, 8M web developers, 600K embedded developers.
There aren't enough embedded developers to do everything.
Need to pull in mobile/web developers.
Linux Foundation conferences don't try to pick winners and losers.
Groups of companies trying to do the right thing.
Multiple companies should decide how IoT works.
Greg Burns started Alljoyn, an open source device communication framework.
Specifics of wire protocol don't matter that much.
Bigger picture, industry benefits if we have one standard.
Political problem remains if technical solved.
