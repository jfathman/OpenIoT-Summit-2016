Linux Connectivity for IoT

Marcel Holtmann - Principal Engineer, Intel
Chair Internet Working Group, Bluetooth SIG
BlueZ (Linux Bluetooth stack) maintainer since 2004

If Linux does not fulfill needs of IoT, something else will come along.
zephyrproject.org for sensors.
ostroproject.org for the gateway.
clearlinux.org for the cloud.
Always some kind of coordinator in the network.
Bluetooth, Thread, ZigBee, ZWave, LTE, Wi-Fi, Ant+, WirelessHART, NFC.
ZigBee for home automation.
Vendor using NFC in a clothes dryer to check diagnostics.
LTE will play a larger role, narrow band.
VLC, visible light communication, used for toys.
802.15.4 low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs).
Easy: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE, NFC.
Complicated: Thread, ZigBee, WirelessHART.
Talk to your lightbulb from Linux laptop.
Linux kernel subsystems for connectivity: Bluetooth, 802.11, 802.15.4, 6LoWPAN, NFC.
Clean driver abstraction, PCI, USB, I2C, UART.
Netlink or socket, programming APIs.
6LoWPAN convergence ongoing, 1 - 2 years more.
wpan.cakelab.org
BlueZ full support for 4.2 and LE.
01.org/bluez
01.org/bluez-android
Small kernel, Bluetooth as small as possible, ~2MB.
NFC neard daemon for Linux.
Supports all major tags, secure element for Linux.
01.org/linux-nfc
ConnMan connection manager.
Wi-Fi management, Bluetooth networking, cellular connectivity handling.
Used in Google Nest thermostat.
DHCP, NTP, nftables.
Manages everything around IPv4/IPv6.
01.org/connman
ofono cellular telephony stack 2G/3G/LTE.
SMS, voice calls, ready for M2M and IoT.
Real telephony stack.
01.org/ofono
IoTivity framework, seamless device to device connectivity.
Wireless and wired technologies.
iotivity.org
Soletta open source framework, libraries for devices.
solettaproject.org
Linux, less than 1 MB.
802.15.4 might come, but start with BTLE off the shelf.
Many choices for IoT connectivity.
Don't choose anything that requires NDA, signed agreement.
