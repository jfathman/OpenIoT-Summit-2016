JavaScript for OCF (Open Connectivity Foundation) Applications

Sakari Poussa - Software Architect at Intel

Vision: Developers use only web technologies to create end-to-end solutions.
CoAP, MQTT, 6LoWPAN, BLE.
Use JavaScript for everything.
Code reuse, consistent APIs.
There are 9M mobile developers, 8M web developers, 600K embedded developers.
IoT will not be built by embedded developers.
IoT startup investment in 2015 was $1.5B.
Node.js as JavaScript runtime for headless devices.
JavaScript V8 engine from Google, Chakra from Microsoft.
libuv event loop, npm, Node Foundation 2015.
POSIX threads doing async I/O multi-threaded.
JavaScript thread running application code is single-threaded.
Experienced pool of developers.
Thoroughly asynchronous, scaled well.
Many packages, including IoT specific.
Perfect for REST API.
Full stack applications, both front end and back end.
Many major services switching to Node.js.
Industry moving to JavaScript/Node.js for IoT.
Modern tooling, Swagger, RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language).
Node.js for IoT.
Great API makes a difference.
Iterative design process.
OCF JavaScript API
  - Node.js
  - Cordova and Crosswalk
  - Tizen
  - Soletta
Promise based OCF framework:
  findResources();
  register();
  retrieve();
  update();
  observe();
OCF: specifications, data models, certification, marketing.
iotivity-node brings JavaScript API to IoTivity framework.
Based on Node.js and IoTivity.
Open source, Travis, sample code, demos.
IoTivity 1.0.1, Node.js 0.10, 0.12, 4.x, 5.x.
Linux Ostro and OS X support.
Moving the repo to iotivity.org.
Apache 2.0 license.
OCF and cloud.
REST API, CoAP over TCP, XMPP.
HTTP to CoAP mapping, protocol translation.
CoAP, Constrained Application Protocol, REST model for small devices.
Node.js, Expressjs, and iotivity-node.
JavaScript on Ostro, new IoT operating system.
Node, OCF API, Express, mraa, MQTT, CoAP, REST API, systemd, firewall rules.
libmraa used to interface with I/O on Galileo, Edison, other platforms.
JavaScript on Soletta.
OCF JavaScript API.
Hardware I/O, GPIO, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM.
JavaScript on Zephyr (MCU RTOS).
JerryScript, Duktape, libtuv, IoT.js.
Node.js subset.
Cordova OCF plugin, Apache Cordova.
API bridge from JavaScript to native for mobile devices.
Cordova plugin exposes JavaScript API to developer.
