Keynote

The Evolution of Open Source to Propel the Growth of the Internet of Things

Mark Skarpness - VP and General Manager of Embedded Systems at Intel

IoTivity focus.
Challenges of security, this is a barrier.
People need to fundamentally believe it's secure.
Need to be able to build devices without being security experts.
Must be able to apply updates.
Connectivity, low energy mesh networks.
Communicate in interoperable standards fashion.
Scalable, need different software stacks per size.
Lifecycle: prototyping, product, sustaining.
How to secure, update, support this device.
We have great prototyping tools, but then fall off a cliff.
So need tools that scale with lifecycle.
IoT OS framework.
Yocto supports or will support Soletta, Ostro, Zephyr.
Zephyr OS runs on MCU too small for Linux.
Real-time OS, open source, Apache 2 license.
Edge devices, modular design.
Zephyr community.
Ostro is Linux targeted at IoT.
Built using Yocto.
Multiarchitecture, customizable.
Sensible build system.
Addresses continuum of lifecycle.
Soletta: portable API, unified API.
Native and JavaScript.
Yocto toolset has five year history, leverage capability.
Extensible SDK, simpler, more accessible than lower level Bitbake.
Embedded development is predominantly done on Windows workstations.
So run Yocto tools in Docker containers.
Containers - clean, isolated build environments.
