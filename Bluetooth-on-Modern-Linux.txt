Bluetooth on Modern Linux

Szymon Janc - CODECOUP

Cofounder at www.codecoup.pl.
Focused on Bluetooth, NFC.
Bluetooth:
  10 - 100 meters.
  2.4 GHz (ISM band).
  Began in 1999, many problems, interop issues.
  2010 LE, 2013 LE improvements, 2014 LE security improvements.
Linux Bluetooth features:
  Bluetooth 4.2
  Audio media, A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile), AVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile).
  Telephony.
  Networking, PAN, 6LoWPAN.
  Input device, HID (Human Interface Device Profile), HOGP (HID Over GATT Profile)
  Split between kernel (low level protocols, security) and user space.
  bluetoothd control daemon, D-Bus interfaces, IPC.
  neard daemon for NFC.
  obexd daemon for OBEX (Object Exchange) profiles.
  Tools: bluetoothctl command line agent, btmon HCI (Host Controller Interface) tracer.
BlueZ for Android, not to be used in Gnu/Linux.
Bluetooth management interface.
Required by BlueZ 5.
Allows userspace to control kernel operations.
Replaces raw HCI sockets.
Available since Linux 3.4.
btmgmt tool for command line.
BlueZ D-Bus interface.
Use this instead of hcitools.
Use standard D-Bus ObjectManager and Properties interface.
/org/bluez/hci0 adapters and remote devices as objects.
Basic operations (GAP) (Generic Access Profile).
Adapter settings, device discovery, connection management, pairing.
org.bluez.Adapter1
org.bluez.Device1
org.bluez.Agent1
D-Bus pass file descriptors among processes.
Telephony, oFono is handling signaling (AT commands), PA is handling voice (SCO).
Suitable for desktop voice (like Hangouts, Skype).
Networking.
org.bluez.NetworkService1 for tethering.
org.bluez.Network1 returns network interface name (bnep0).
Support for PAN (Personal Area Network) profile.
Support in NetworkManager, ConnMan.
obexd:
  FTP file transfer profile.
  OPP object push profile.
  PBAP phone book access profile.
  MAP message access profile.
D-Bus session bus.
D-Bus advertising, experimental but stable.
Allows external apps to register advertising data.
org.bluez.LEAdvertisingManager1 on /org/bluez/hciX
Currently no support for scan responses.
D-Bus GATT (Generic Attribute Profile) is experimental.
LE connection oriented channels.
sk = socket(PF_BLUETOOTH, type, BTPROTO_L2CAP)
connect(sk, ...)
6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) over BLE.
Simple to use.
modprobe bluetooth_6lowpan
ping6 -l bt0 xxxx:..:xxxx
Custom solutions.
Ideal for beacons or simple peripheral apps.
User channel.
Gives HCI exclusive access to user space application.

Tips:
  Use D-Bus API.
  Don't use hcitool.
  Use bluetoothctl, btmgmt instead.
  For HCI traces, use btmon instead of hcidump.
  Old kernel?  Use Linux backports project.

Config: /sys/class/bluetooth, /sys/kernel.
Debug: bluetoothd -n -d -E, or SIGUSR2.
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf
BLE mesh networking coming soon.
